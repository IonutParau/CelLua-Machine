180° Rotator Cell - Rotates cells 180 degrees. <br>

Puller Cell - Pulls cells. Does not push cells. <br>

Diverger Cell - Any forces that come into the sides which the arrows point to get rotated 90° and teleported to the end of the diverger. Quite buggy, dont be too surprised if a crash can happen. If an infinite loop slips by but is detected as it happens, it will stop the loop and create a trash cell, for debugging purposes. <br>

Redirector Cell - Replaces the rotation of the 4 cells it touches with it's own rotation. <br>

Gear Cell - Grabs the 8 cells nearby and rotates them 45 degrees around itself. Cells going from diagonally adjacent to orthogonally adjacent will have their rotation adjusted. <br>

Mold Cell - Upon being generated by a generator, the generated cell will disappear (but the forces from being cloned will still apply.) <br>

Repulse Cell - Applies a pushing force in all 4 directions. <br>

Weight Cell - This cell will effectively remove the force from one mover that is trying to push it. They will stack with each other. <br>
