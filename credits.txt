The people who created the ideas for the cells currenly in game (and that weren't in Mystic Mod already):

180 Rotator, Puller, Generator variants, Slide cell variants - Too general of an idea to give credit to any specific person

Freezer Cell - Came up on my own

Gear Cell - Inspired by Sam Hogan's original idea for the Rotator Cell ("grabs and spins cells around it")

Mold Cell - i fell onto water and died#7501 (although i couldn't make it pass-through sorry)

Strong Enemy - Blendi Goose#0414 (or at least he's the person who finally convinced me to add it)

Diverger Cell (renamed from Redirector) - blaumeise20#4088

Repulsor Cell - fanhalo#6922

Redirector Cell - HeavenlyMessiah#4604

Mirror Cell - Fowo Vinvalut#8835

Weight Cell (renamed from "condition cell") - Spunky_Dollish_2#6870
